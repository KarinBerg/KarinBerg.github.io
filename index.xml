      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Karin Berg
I am currently a mobile and backend developer at Daimler Trucks AG. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not nailed down to that. I&amp;rsquo;m open to do whatever is necessary to create useful products. This is my passion and what drives me forward.
My strongest skill is my flexibility to switch between the role of a software developer and a coordinator. I try to fill any gap I notice which helps the team to reach the goal.</description>

      <description>Short description:
Prometheus exporter for Microsoft AppCenter information e.g. the ui test runs. This project is a copy of the Azure DevOps Exporter which I adjusted to scrape information from the Microsoft AppCenter instead of MicrosoftAzure DevOps. We use it to alert us in case of failing ui tests of our apps.

      <title>iCashBox - From idea to App Store in 48 hours</title>
      <link>https://karinberg.github.io/projects/project1/</link>

      <description>iOS Mobile App: iCashBox
App idea: The basic idea was to develop an app with which it is possible to manage a holiday fund or similar. Think of the next skiing holiday, for example. 5 people go skiing together and each one throws 100 â‚¬ into the holiday fund to pay for food, petrol, etc. This app should help you to keep track of the expenses and receipts of each person.</description>
