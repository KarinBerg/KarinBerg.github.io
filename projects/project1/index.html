<p><strong>iOS Mobile App:</strong> <a href="http://appstore.com/icashbox"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iCashBox</a></p>
<p><strong>App idea:</strong>
The basic idea was to develop an app with which it is possible to manage a holiday fund or similar.
Think of the next skiing holiday, for example. 5 people go skiing together and each one throws 100 € into the holiday fund to pay for food, petrol, etc. This app should help you to keep track of the expenses and receipts of each person. It should also help you to calculate who has to pay what and who gets how much back.</p>
<p><strong>Why in 48 hours?</strong>
Even in 2011 it was increasingly difficult to successfully launch an app in the App Store without it ending in triviality. Therefore we had the idea to document the programming weekend e.g. with a time-lapse recording to create a short video showing the development process of the app. This could then be published as a kind of &ldquo;look behind the scenes&rdquo;.
The hope was that a publication e.g. at iFun.de or the like would give the app a certain market.</p>
