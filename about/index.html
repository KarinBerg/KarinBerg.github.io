    <p><strong>Hi! I&rsquo;m Karin</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am</strong>
currently working part-time as a freelance mobile developer and DevOps Engineer. The other part I work as DevOps engineer for <a href="https://www.mobisys.de"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobisys</a>.</p>
<p>My background is diverse (you could say I&rsquo;m a specialized generalist), but always close to coding. I have done a bit of everything, from backend development to mobile apps and devops topics.</p>
<p>I love automation as a way to optimize processes and avoid repetitive work, and working in happy agile teams - where work is a way to design beautiful products that solve a problem, and not a mean by itself.</p>
<p><strong>My strongest skill is</strong>
my flexibility to switch between the role of a software developer and a coordinator. I try to fill any gap I notice which helps the team to reach the goal.</p>
<p>If you ask the <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CliftonStrenght 34 profile</a> my five strongest strenght are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restorative - You are adept at dealing with problems. You are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empathy - You can sense other people’s feelings by imagining yourself in others’ lives or situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achiever - You work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. You take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learner - You have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsibility - You take psychological ownership of what you say you will do. You are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m interested in</strong>
any new technology which helps me to build useful products better and faster. If I&rsquo;m not sitting in front of the MacBook, I go for a ride with my motorbike, traveling with Berry (our Camper ;) ), playing table tennis, learn playing guitar or just enjoy a glas of wine with my husband :)</p>
